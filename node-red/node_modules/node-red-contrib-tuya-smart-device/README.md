# Setup

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The node takes one input and one output. Once you drop the node into the flow, you need to use the deviceid and devicekey that you got from the getting started step. 

Once you setup the node, you can then use input to send any command to the device as per the tuya standards.
